## How to Use

1.  Open `index.html` in a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.
2.  The app will first ask for permission to show notifications. This is required for the timers and reminders to work correctly.
3.  Choose a main concentration timer from the dropdown.
4.  Enable any background reminders you'd like (20-20-20 Rule, Standing Desk, Water).
5.  Click "Start" to begin your session.

**Note on Notifications:** If notifications do not appear, please check your browser's site settings and your operating system's notification/focus settings (e.g., "Focus Assist" on Windows or "Do Not Disturb" on macOS).
